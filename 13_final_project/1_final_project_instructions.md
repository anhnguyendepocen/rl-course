Reinforcement Learning Final Project
=====
 
Purpose: Implement a Reinforcement Learning solution for a __novel__ task. By novel, I mean a task that has no existing Reinforcement Learning solutions. The task could be a game, a puzzle, a dataset, a business problem, or something else.

Learning Outcomes:
----

- Formulate a meaningful and answerable Reinforcement Learning applied research question.
- Implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm(s) to answer that applied research question. 
- Create a system that learns from the data to get better at the task.
- Communicate your process and findings to a technical audience.
- Write working and well-organized code.

Note - "Solving" the task, aka an optimal solution, is __not__ required.

Instructions
----

This is your project so it is up to you to develop the right applied research question. The instructor will approve the research question to make sure it is appropriate for your skill level and within scope of the class. Acquiring data should not take away from the other aspects of the project (i.e., no collecting or web scraping the data). You can use "toy" data or synthetic data.

This project can either be individual or teams of two people.

This project will become a part of your public portfolio, thus all data and code must be public. Both data and code should have an appropriate license.  

The course materials are a brief (and opinionated) tour of Reinforcement Learning. You can directly apply course materials to a new problem, extend course materials, or go beyond the course materials. Anything within a board definition of Reinforcement Learning is fair game. Just ask the instructor.

It is best if all ideas and code are original with you. However, you can build on prior work. If you choose to incorporate prior work, the project will be more challenging because you'll have to be very clear what was previously done and what is your unique contribution. You must cite all ideas and code immediately adjacent (i.e., comments or markdown cell with hyperlinks). See course materials for examples. __Failure to cite any ideas and code, will result in an automatic 0 on this project.__

The primary deliverabls are :

1. A short (less than 10 minutes) asynchronous online video presentation posted to YouTube.
2. A GitHub repository containing your Jupyter Notebooks and another material.

The signup sheet is on Canvas.

How the Peer Feedback will work
------

You'll make your video and code public no later than 06-26 11am. Failure to do so will result in loss of 17% of Final Project grade per hour the entire project is not public). You are required to watch and review 3 other projects assigned to you. Similar to the prework check, those reviews will be judged on "good faith" attempts. If you give "good faith" feedback to your peers before the 1pm deadline, you'll get all the peer feedback points as an item on __your__ Final Project score. *The peer feedback you give will not impact the other student's project scores.* 

You can continue to improve your own project until the freeze 06-26 6pm (hopefully based on the peer feedback.)

Final Project Tips:
----

- Make it run, make it right, make it fast. (in that order)
- Go end-to-end as quickly possible, then explore options for each stage:
    1. Define problem 
    2. Create environment 
    3. Implement simple algorithm 
    4. Examine empirical evidence of learning. 
- Your project has to show evidence of learning, meaning the algorithm performs above chance. In order to get a high grade, you do __not__ need to completely solve the problem or find the provably optimal policy. The goal is to create working code to better under a specific problem with Reinforcement Learning.
- How do I get a "A"? 
    - Do something groundbreaking (seriously). Either ground-breaking for the field or for the class.
    - Fit models and use methodology from outside class materials.
